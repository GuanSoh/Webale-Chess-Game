# Webale-Chess-Game
This is a chess game with special rules. This project was created for the subject Object-oriented analysis and design. My teammate Chong Kai Siang, Choong Lee Hung and Khaw Wen Kang
also contributed to this project.


## Game Rule:

* The Sun can only move one step in any direction. The game ends when the Sun is captured by the other side.

* The Chevron moves in an L shape: 2 steps in one direction then 1 step perpendicular to it. (Similar to the Knight in the normal chess.) It is the only piece that can skip over the other pieces.

* The Triangle can move any number of steps diagonally.

* The Plus can move any number of steps up and down, or left and right.

* The Arrow can only move 1 or 2 steps forward each time, but when it reaches the other edge of the board, it turns around and heads back in the opposite direction. (The icon should also turn around when that happens.)

* After blue has moved 2 times, all the blue Triangles will turn into Pluses and vice versa. Similarly, after red has moved 2 times, all the red Triangles will turn into Plusses and vice versa. 


## Game Features:
* Provide save and Load
* Game Board will be rotate when change round.
